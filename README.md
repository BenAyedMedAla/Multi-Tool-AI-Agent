# Multi-Tool-AI-Agent
This project implements an AI agent using the LLaMA 3.2 model in combination with external tools like weather and web search APIs. The agent provides responses based on user queries by utilizing web search and weather data.

## Features

- **Weather Data**: Get current weather information for any location using the Weather API.
- **Web Search**: Perform web searches and return top results using the Tavily Search API.
- **LLaMA 3.2 Model**: Use the LLaMA 3.2 model for natural language understanding and decision-making.
- **Tools Integration**: Integrates weather and web search as tools to fetch data dynamically and provide useful responses.

## Tools

- **Weather API**: Fetches real-time weather data for a given location.
- **Tavily Search API**: Performs advanced web searches and returns relevant results.
- **LLaMA 3.2**: A large language model used to interact with users and provide responses based on input and tools.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BenAyedMedAla/Multi-Tool-AI-Agent.git
   cd Multi-Tool-AI-Agent

2. **Install dependencies**:

-Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.

-Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate


-Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Set up environment variables**:
-Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
-Add your API keys to the .env file

According to the weather information, it will be misty in Trivandrum today with a temperature of 27.2°C (81.0°F). There is no precipitation expected, and the wind speed is approximately 11.5 km/h from the northwest direction. The humidity level is around 84%.

## How It Works
-The agent uses tools (like get_weather and search_web) to interact with external services.

-LangChain integrates these tools into a conversational flow using StateGraph to process messages and determine the next action.

-The LLaMA model interacts with the tools, processes responses, and generates human-like conversational replies.

## Future Improvements
-Add more tools for additional functionalities like text generation, language translation, or image processing.

-Optimize performance for large-scale queries and integrate more advanced AI models for better conversation handling.
